At Maebeetv.com, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose personal information that we may receive when you use our website.

Cookies and Personalized Advertising

Like many other websites, we use cookies to enhance your user experience and serve personalized advertising. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website or other websites.

Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt-out of personalized advertising by visiting Ads Settings. (Alternatively, you can direct users to opt-out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting www.aboutads.info.)

If you have not opted out of third-party ad serving, the cookies of other third-party vendors or ad networks may also be used to serve ads on your site. In this case, we notify our site visitors of the third-party vendors and ad networks serving ads on our site, and provide links to the appropriate vendor and ad network websites. We also inform our users that they may visit those websites to opt-out of the use of cookies for personalized advertising (if the vendor or ad network offers this capability).
Information Collection and Use

When you visit Maebeetv.com, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the pages you visit on our site. We may use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movements around the site, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We may also collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us, such as your name and email address when you subscribe to our newsletter or contact us through our website. We will never sell or rent your personal information to any third party without your consent.
