            Like many other websites, we use cookies to enhance your user
            experience and serve personalized advertising. Third-party vendors,

            visits to your website or other websites.

            Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to
            serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or
            other sites on the Internet. Users may opt-out of personalized
            advertising by visiting Ads Settings. (Alternatively, you can direct
            users to opt-out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for
            personalized advertising by visiting www.aboutads.info.)

            If you have not opted out of third-party ad serving, the cookies of
            other third-party vendors or ad networks may also be used to serve
            ads on your site. In this case, we notify our site visitors of the
            third-party vendors and ad networks serving ads on our site, and
            provide links to the appropriate vendor and ad network websites. We
            also inform our users that they may visit those websites to opt-out
            of the use of cookies for personalized advertising (if the vendor or
            ad network offers this capability). Information Collection and Use.
